#Turing Machine Language Interpreter in Python
### © Flanders Lorton 2016

####I wrote this language and interpreter from scratch to generate turing machines and run them in Python.

####This language is turing complete by definition


##Example machine: Add 1 to a binary number
The input starts with '$'. The '$' will be overwritten if the 1 is carried out.

###machine.tm
```
Input($1011)
q1 = {start, (1->1,R,q1), (0->0,R,q1), ($->$,R,q1), (#->#,L,q2)} 
q2 = {(1->0,L,q2), (0->1,S,q3), ($->1,S,q3)}
q3 = {accept}
Output()
```
###Usage

`python TuringMachine.py machine.tm`

###Output for machine.tm
```
$1100
True
```

##Turing Machine Language Syntax:

The machine returns `True` if it hits an accept state

The machine returns `False` if it hits a reject state

There is so guarantee the machine will ever stop if it never hits an accept or reject

###Input
Input can only be called once

it can be passed zero or more non-whitespace characters.

Input will be empty if not called

if Input is empty, input can be passed as a command line arg

`python TuringMachine.py machine.tm 10020`
```
Input()
Input(Hello)
Input(2312jsndjn32n:"]\-!!2~k3n4n5)
```
###Output
Output can only be called once

if nothing is pass to Output, the machine will print the whole tape

if Output is not called, nothing will print

Output takes one or two ints (x,y) or (x)

The machine will print the tape from x inclusive to y non-inclusive

if the index of y is beyond the length of the tape, the machine will print the whole tape with one or more `#` at the end
```
Output()
Output(1,5)
Output(3)
```

###States
**states** must be written in the following format

`name = {modifier, edges }`or `name = { edges }` 

or `name = {modifier}` if it is an accept or reject state

if you want a machine to always accept or reject you can have the start state accept of reject
````
//HelloWorld.tm
Input(Hello_World!)
q1 = {start, accept}
Output()
````

**name** must consist of one or more non-whitespace characters.

names must be unique for each state

**modifier** must be:

`start`  only one start state per machine

`accept` or `reject`these states should not have edges

you can have multiple accept and reject states but there's no reason to

**edges**

edges must we written in the following format

seperate multiple edges with commas

`(readChar -> writeChar , moveTape, nextState)`

**readChar**

readChar can be any non-whitespace character that will be read from the tape in the current position

or a `#` to reference the end of the tape

**writeChar**

writeChar can be any non-whitespace character that will be written to the tape in the current position

or a `#` to reference the end of the tape

**moveTape**

moveTape must be `R` `L` or `S`

these correspond to a move of Right Left or Stay from the current position

if the tape tries to move Left from the leftmost tape position, it will stay in place

if the tape moves Right from the right most position, it will move and write a `#` to the empty space

**nextState**

nextState must be a declared state name


####Example States
````
q1 = {start, (1->1,R,q1), (0->0,R,q1), ($->$,R,q1), (#->#,L,q2)}
stateX = {(5->1,S,q1)}
q2 = {(1->0,L,q2), (0->1,S,q3), ($->1,S,q3)}
q3 = {accept}
q4 = {accept}
state17 = {reject}
````

###Comments

All text after each line will be ignored
Do not put text before code

Singleline comments must start with `//`
````
q2 = {(1->0,L,q2), (0->1,S,q3), ($->1,S,q3)}   This is a comment
q3 = {accept}                                  #this too
//another comment
Output()                                       //me four
```

###MissingEdgeReject

Because Turing Machine Language has some minor error reporting, 

If the machine cannot find an edge for the current state and tape value it will crash and give an error such as:

`RuntimeError: Could not find an edge for char: '0' from state: q8`

However, sometimes you want a machine to reject if it gets to a state it cannot continue from.

So, to make your machine reject if it hits a missing edge, call `MissingEdgeReject()` once anywhere in your fie.

see `machine2.tm` & `machine3.tm` for an example


###Bugs&Errors

This interpreter is new and is not extensively tested.
